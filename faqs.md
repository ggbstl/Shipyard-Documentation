If you want to start using Shipyard, you can [sign up here](https://app.shipyardapp.com/auth/signup?ref=docs-faq). Once you sign up, you'll start your free 14-day trial. 

## How do I submit feedback or a feature request?

We love to hear what our users would like to see out of our product. Feel free to reach us at any time through intercom \(the chat bubble on the right\) or by sending an email directly to [support@shipyardapp.com](mailto:support@shipyardapp.com)

## What programming languages do you support?

We currently natively support the creation of solutions using Python 3.7 and Bash. Bash allows us to support any language non-natively, where the right language packages just need to be manually installed by the user.

SQL can be used natively with some Blueprints found in the [Blueprint Library](reference/blueprint-library.md).

In the future, we plan to expand our native language support to R and Node.js.

If you have a language that you would like to see supported, let us know!

## Is Shipyard a no-code tool?

Shipyard is not inherently a no-code tool, although the platform allows technical teams to turn coded solutions into no-code Blueprints that can be used by anyone in the organization.

Additionally, we offer a wide variety of Blueprints in our [Blueprint Library](reference/blueprint-library.md) that don't require code to use.

## What skills do I need to get started with Shipyard?

Shipyard is a workflow automation platform for technical team members. As long as you know how to write a little bit of code in SQL, Python, Bash, you can build and launch almost any solution that doesn't need a UI. We've made the platform as easy as possible for you to take your existing coding skills, no matter how complex they are, and solve problems at scale.

If you have proprietary business logic needs, you will likely need at least one technical team member that can initially build solutions for the organization. However, other users of Shipyard are **not** required to know code. We built the platform to allow business users the ability to easily access and take advantage of internally built solutions \([Custom Blueprints](https://intercom.help/shipyardapp/en/articles/3526186-what-is-a-custom-blueprint)\).

If you have standard needs to run QA on your data, deliver reports, and send data to external partners, you will be able to get by using only the Blueprints found in our [Blueprint Library](reference/blueprint-library.md).

If you have an idea of something you want to solve, and you're not sure if it's possible with Shipyard, reach out to us!

## What Technology Stack do you use?

Shipyard was built from the ground-up using Go for all of the backend code.

Our frontend is entirely designed using Node, React.js, and the Ant Design framework.

All of our cloud infrastructure is built on Amazon Web Services.

For a more detailed view at the technology we use across the company, see our [StackShare profile](https://stackshare.io/shipyard/shipyard).

## Why should I use Shipyard over Open-Source Software solutions?

Our team are big believers in OSS. We even use some of it to build out our own services \(and contribute to some projects in this way\)! However, relying on OSS can present it's own challenges when something isn't working. To fix the problem, you'll either have to wait for someone else to prioritize the bug, or develop workarounds on your own.

By making Shipyard a platform that prioritizes payment, we're able to provide customers with a high level of service and reaction time to fixing any bugs that may arise. You'll spend less development time wrangling with setup, troubleshooting, and constant adjustments of infrastructure. If you need a feature to help support your business, we can work with you to build it. We believe that trade-off is worth it for any business serious about implementing automation and using their data pipelines for the long term.

## I need to whitelist Shipyard's IP Addresses. What are those?

Any requests coming from Shipyard will come from the following IPs.

* 54.190.66.63
* 52.42.73.100

If you still have trouble with Shipyard being able to access data from internal systems or 3rd parties, reach out to [support](mailto:support@shipyardapp.com).

## How much does Shipyard cost?

We have plans that start at $50/month. Each plan is fully featured and capable of automating the most complex workflows. These plans scale based on the number of users in your organization and the overall runtime across all your Vessels.
