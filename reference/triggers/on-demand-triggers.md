# On Demand Triggers

## Definition

On the top navigation pane for every Vessel and Fleet, you are given a **Run Now** button in the top-right. Clicking this button will cause the Vessel or Fleet to schedule a voyage immediately. You will then be re-directed to the newly created log. 

* For Vessel logs, live data and output will be shown without you needing to refresh.
* For Fleet logs, you'll need to manually refresh the page to see updates.

## Limitations

1. Vessels may not run instantaneously, as there is still time associated with entering a job queue, spinning up servers, and installing any packages provided in Requirements.
