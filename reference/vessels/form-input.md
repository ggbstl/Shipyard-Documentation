# Inputs

## Definition

The Inputs tab contains both the full description of a Custom Blueprint \(left\) and all of the Inputs \(right\) that need to be filled out in order to build a Vessel.

### Description

The description is a long-form explanation of what a Blueprint does. This will often include instructions for users to ensure that they can use the Blueprint with no issues. This information is set in a [Blueprints' ](../blueprints/)settings on the [Information Card](information-card.md).

### Inputs

The inputs are a direct reflection of the [Blueprint Variables ](../blueprints/blueprint-variables.md)that are set up for the selected [Blueprint](../blueprints/).
