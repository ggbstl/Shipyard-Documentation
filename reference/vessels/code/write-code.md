# Write Code

## Definition

The in-app editor allows you to copy and paste your code directly into Shipyard and make changes as needed. Alternatively, you can write your code from scratch. If this option is selected, both the **file name** and **code** fields must be filled out.

When first setting up a Vessel or Blueprint, the **file name** that you type will be mirrored in the [file to run](command.md#file-to-run) field.

This solution is perfect for smaller code snippets that you may need to change and edit on the fly.

## Limitations

1. The in-app editor only supports editing one file per Vessel.
2. You cannot include folder names in the File Name field. The file will always be created in the current working directory.
