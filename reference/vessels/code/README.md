# Code

## Definition

The Code tab contains all of the details necessary to run your scripts as Vessels. Contents of this tab may differ slightly based on the language selected. Shipyard currently supports executing code written in Python, Node, or Bash \(which can effectively run any language\).

The left pane contains a section to provide Shipyard with your code. There are 3 different methods:

* [Write Code](write-code.md)
* [Upload Code](upload-code.md)
* [Github Code Sync](github-code-sync.md)

The right pane contains a section to provide the [Command](command.md) of which file to execute and which arguments to pass to the file.

All code executed on our platform is subject to our [Terms of Service](https://www.shipyardapp.com/legal/terms).
