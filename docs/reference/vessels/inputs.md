# Inputs

## Definition

The Inputs tab contains both the full description of a Blueprint \(left\) and all of the Inputs \(right\) that need to be filled out in order to build a Vessel.

### Description

The [description](../blueprints/blueprint-description) is a long-form explanation of what a Blueprint does. This will often include instructions for users to ensure that they can use the Blueprint with no issues.

### Inputs

The inputs are a direct reflection of the [Blueprint Variables ](../blueprints/blueprint-variables) that are set up for the selected [Blueprint](../blueprints/blueprints-overview).

These fields allow a user to input data that a script uses, without the need to code.
