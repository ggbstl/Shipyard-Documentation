# Guardrails

## Definition

Guardrails help make sure that your Vessel runs successfully, no matter the situation. Use guardrails to avoid a Vessel or Fleet from failing out due to smaller, unpredictable problems like timing or connection issues.

Guardrails consist of two options:

### **Number of Retries**

Indicates the number of times that Vessels should be retried if they error out. By default, Vessels are set to "Never Retry" with the option to retry up to 3 times.

### **Time Between Retries**

After a failure, the amount of time before Shipyard will try to run the Vessel again. By default, the platform will try "As Soon As Possible", but the delay can be set in increments of 5 minutes, with up to a 60 minute delay.

## Limitations

1. Retries only occur after the current Vessel has run into an error. You cannot retry a Vessel based on another condition or output of another Vessel.
2. Retries only happen using a time interval.
3. The option of retrying ASAP may actually result in a slight delay, due to the queuing and scheduling system of the application.
4. The timing interval between retries is required to be consistent - you can't have the retry interval grow, shrink, or change variably.
