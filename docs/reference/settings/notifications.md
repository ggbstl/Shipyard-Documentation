# Notifications

## Definition

Notifications provide an automated way to receive updates about the Vessels you care most about. By default, a Vessel will send a notification for the following events:

- If the Vessel errors out
- If the Vessel completes an On-Demand run

When initially creating a Vessel, the owner's email will be added automatically. You can always add additional user emails to be notified about the Vessel. Emails provided do not have to have access to Shipyard to receive a notification.

**Tip**: You can paste a comma-separated list of emails into the field and it will automatically separate them all.

## Additional Notes

1. Notifications can only be sent via email. No other messaging platforms are supported at this time.
2. Notification settings are the same for every user that is listed.
3. Notifications are only sent for 3 different event types. These event types cannot be changed at the moment.
4. Notifications are only applied at the Vessel and Fleet level. You cannot subscribe to notifications for a Blueprint \(and therefore all dependent Vessels\).
