# How to Duplicate a Vessel

## Overview

Sometimes, you'll want to re-use the existing components of a Vessel with only a few slight changes. In these cases, duplication will allow you to avoid the hassle of manually repeating an existing configuration.

## Steps

1. Select the name of the Vessel that you want to duplicate, or click the edit button.
2. Select the duplicate button in the bottom-right hand corner.

At this point, your Vessel has been successfully duplicated with a name that indicates the Vessel it was originally a copy of. However, we recommend making a few adjustments.

1. Set up new Triggers, if you want them.
2. Decide on a new Vessel name.
3. Set your Vessel's state to Active.
4. Save your newly Duplicated Vessel.
