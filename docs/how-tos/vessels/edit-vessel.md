# How to Edit a Vessel

## Overview

If you find yourself needing to update existing code, change a Trigger, or even update external package versions, you'll likely want to edit an existing Vessel. Follow these steps for editing a Vessel.

## Steps

1. From the "All Projects" page, navigate to the project where your Vessel lives.
2. Next to the Vessel you want to edit, click on the "Edit" link, located on the right-hand side of the table under the column for "Action". By default, you'll land on the settings tab for the Vessel. Every tab, except for Logs, has fields that can be added or edited. These fields will look extremely similar to what you see when initially creating a Vessel.
3. Edit any and all fields that need updating. You can make multiple updates across multiple tabs.
4. Once finished, click the "Save button at the bottom of the page.
