# How to Search for a Vessel

## Overview

Sometimes you can end up with hundreds of Vessels across your projects, making it harder to find the exact Vessel that you're looking for. We recommend going through the following steps to find a Vessel that you may be looking for.

## Steps

1. Click into a Project where you think the Vessel lives. Good project names will help you better organize the Vessels that you create.
2. On the Active Vessels table, click the "Magnifying Glass" icon right next to "Vessel Name".
3. Type the words you want to find. All of Shipyard's search fields are case insensitive.
4. Click the "Search" button.
5. If a matching Vessel was found, you'll see the table filter to these Vessels.

If no matching Vessel was found, you'll see a screen that says "No Vessels Found". You can try the following options:

1. Try a different search term.
2. Search for the owner, if you know who created it.
3. Search for the Vessel on the "Inactive Vessels" table.
4. Try a different project.

If you still can't find the Vessel you're looking for, you may also be able to find it by selecting all Dependent Vessels under a Custom Blueprint and searching that way.

:::caution
**Note**: There is currently not a way to search for a Vessel across multiple projects or multiple states in the UI.
