# How to Search for a Vessel

## Overview

Sometimes you can end up with hundreds of Vessels across your projects, making it harder to find the exact Vessel that you're looking for. This how to guide will walk you through the steps to find a Vessel that you're looking for.

## Steps

1. Navigate to the project where you think your Vessel lives.
2. Click the magnifying glass icon (![Magnifying Glass Icon](../../.gitbook/assets/magnifying-glass.png)) right next to Vessel Name.
3. Type the words you want to find. All of Shipyard's search fields are case insensitive.
4. Click the **Search** button.
   1. If a matching Vessel was found, you'll see the table filter to these Vessels.
   2. If no matching Vessel was found, you'll see a screen that says "No Vessels match your filters.". You can try a different search term, try filtering other fields, or try a different Project.
