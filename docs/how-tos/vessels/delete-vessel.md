# How to Delete a Vessel

## Overview

You may have an old Vessel that should no longer be used, or maybe you just set something up the wrong way. You can follow these steps to easily delete the Vessel.

## Steps

1. From the "All Projects" page, navigate to the project where your Vessel lives.
2. Next to the Vessel you want to delete, click on the "Delete" link, located on the right-hand side of the table under the column for "Action".
3. Confirm that you really want to delete the Vessel.

Alternatively, if you are currently editing an existing Vessel:

1. Click the red "Delete" text at the bottom of the page.
2. Confirm that you really want to delete the Vessel.
