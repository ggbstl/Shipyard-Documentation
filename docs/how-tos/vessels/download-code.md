# How to Download Code

## Overview

You may run into an instance where you need to see what code a Vessel is actively running to understand changes that need to be made. Here are the steps to accomplish that.

## Steps

1. Navigate to the Vessel or Blueprint that you need the code from by clicking the "Edit" button.
2. Switch to the "Code" tab.
3. On the left-hand side, click the "Upload" tab if it's not already selected.
4. Towards the bottom, you should see a file name, highlighted. Click this file name to download the code.

:::caution
**Note**: You cannot download code from a Vessel that is built on a Custom Blueprint. Instead, you'll need to navigate to the Blueprint itself.
