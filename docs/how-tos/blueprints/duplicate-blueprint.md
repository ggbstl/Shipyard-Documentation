# How to Duplicate a Blueprint

## Overview

Sometimes, you'll want to re-use the existing components of a Blueprint with only a few slight changes. In these cases, [duplication](../../reference/other-functions/duplication.md) will allow you to avoid the hassle of manually repeating an existing configuration. This how to guide will walk you through the steps to duplicate a Blueprint.

## Steps

### Step 1 - Navigate to the Blueprint
1. Click the **Blueprints** navigation button on the side navigation.
2. Find the Blueprint that you want to edit.
3. Click either the **Edit** action or the **Blueprint Name**.
4. Click the **Duplicate** button at the bottom.

You've now successfully duplicated a Blueprint and are viewing the copy.

### Step 2 - Edit the Duplicate
While the Blueprint has been successfully duplicated, it contains a less readable name that indicates the Blueprint it was originally a copy of. We recommend making a few adjustments before moving on.

1. Decide on a new Blueprint name.
2. Set your Blueprint's state to Active.
3. Edit the Blueprint to make any other minor tweaks you want. 
4. Click **Save**.
