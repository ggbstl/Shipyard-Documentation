# How to Create a New Blueprint

## Overview

Every repeatable solution you create will require you to build a Blueprint. These are created extremely similarly to Vessels built with a Code Blueprint.

1. Navigate to your organizations Blueprints using the side navigation.
2. Click the "Create Blueprint" button in the top-right.

At this point you'll be walked through the following 5 pages of setup. If at any point in the process, you want to go to a previous step, you can either click on the step process number at the top, or click the "Back" button at the bottom. You can also completely delete your unfinished progress by clicking "Cancel".

## Steps

### **Select Language**

1. Select the language that you want to use to build your Vessel. The language you select will determine how options are presented to you on future pages.

### **Create Variables**

1. Click the "+" button next to the "Blueprint Variables" header. A drawer on the right hand side of the screen will open up.
2. Give your Variable a Display Name \(for showing to users\) and a Reference Name \(for accessing the user input\).
3. Select the Variable Type. This changes the format of how the user needs to provide their input.
4. Fill out all other fields. These are optional, but recommended.
5. Click the "Add Variable Button".
6. Repeat until you've created all of the variables you need. Once your variables have been created, you'll be able to see a Preview of how it will look to users on the right-hand side of the screen.
7. Click "Next Step" once you're done.

### **Provide Code**

All of the information on this page is required.

1. Provide the **code** for your solution, either by uploading a file or writing your code directly in the UI. This is required.
2. Provide the **command** details necessary for your code to run properly. This is also required.
3. Click Next Step once you're done.

### **Define Requirements**

All of the information on this page is optional.

1. Provide any **environment variables** that your script uses.
2. Provide any **external packages** that your script needs to use.
3. Click Next Step once you're done.

### **Save Settings**

1. If you want to test your Blueprint out before letting normal users access it, set the State as "Test". Otherwise, set to "Active".
2. Give your Blueprint a unique, descriptive name.
3. Optionally, edit the **guardrails** to make the system automatically retry Vessels built with your Blueprint upon an error.
4. Click Save and Finish once you're done

At this point, you should have successfully created a Blueprint and will see the following screen.
