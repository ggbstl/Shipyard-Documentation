# How to Create a New Project

## Overview

If you find yourself needing to create additional Vessels or Fleets that have a common theme and purpose, you'll likely want to create a new [Project](../../reference/projects.md). This how to guide will walk you through the steps to create a new Project.

## Steps

1. On the sidebar, click **Projects** and **View All Projects**.
2. Click the **New Project** button in the top-right corner, or click the dashed card that says New Project.
3. Give your project a name that's descriptive and easy to understand.
4. Set your project's [timezone](../../reference/other-functions/timestamps-and-timezones.md). All Vessels created under this project will use this timezone for [Triggers](../../reference/triggers/triggers-overview.md).
5. Click the **Create** button at the bottom of the page.
