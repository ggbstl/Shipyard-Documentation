# How to Create a New Fleet

## Overview

If you want multiple [Vessels](../../reference/vessels.md) to work together for a larger goal, then you want to set up a [Fleet](../../reference/fleets.md). This how to guide will walk you through the steps to create a Fleet.

## Steps

1. Follow our how to guide to build at least two Vessels, either [with code](../vessels/build-vessel-code.md) or [with a blueprint](../vessels/build-vessel-blueprint.md), that you want to be run as part of your Fleet.
2. Within the project where you created these two Vessels, navigate to the Fleets tab.
3. Click the **+ New** button at the top.
4. On the blank canvas below, click to add a Vessel and select your Vessel name from the dropdown.
5. Repeat the previous step for your other Vessels.
6. Hover over your Vessels until purple dots appear. Click and drag from the purple dots of one Vessel to another Vessel to create a path. Continue until all Vessels are connected together in the order you want.
7. Click the paths to edit their conditions (if needed).
8. Click **Next Step**.
9. Give your Fleet a Name.
10. Click **Save & Finish**.
