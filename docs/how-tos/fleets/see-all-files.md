# How to See All Available Files in a Fleet

## Overview

When running a Fleet, . Sometimes it can be difficult to remember all of the files that are available.

## Steps

1. Create a Bash Vessel.
2. Create a file name and paste `ls -a -R` into the code. This code lists all files in every directory.
3. Complete the remaining steps and save your Vessel.
4. Navigate to the Fleet you want to see files in.
5. Add the Vessel to the Fleet and connect it to existing Vessels. We recommend connecting it towards the end of the Fleet. Location matters!
6. Save the Fleet.
7. Click **Run Now**
8. Once the Fleet has finished running, navigate to the Log for the Bash Vessel you just added.

Congratulations! At this point, you should see an output that shows all of the available files in the Fleet.
